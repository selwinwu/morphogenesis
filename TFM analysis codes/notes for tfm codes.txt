###Notes for TFM Analysis Codes###

Plugins for codes:
TFM_step1_ForPIVImages.ijm: Install MultiStackReg and TurboReg (find in Help --> Update ...)
TFM_step2_LoopFTTC: Install FTTC (from Help --> Update...)
tfm_quantification_ht_chris.m: copy natsort.m, natsortfiles.m, ReadImageJROI.m, and roi_to_mask.m to the same folder
forcemap_radial_chris.m : copy redblue.m to the same folder


TFM_step1_ForPIVImages.ijm aligns the WithCells to Ref (WithCells is the one being shifted for correction),
TFM_step1_ForPIVImages (align ref to cells).ijm does the opposite.
Usually the WithCells images has no significant xy drift from one timepoint to another.
Thus, I prefer using the later code as I don't have to load the transformation matrices and align the GFP, RFP, or DIC channel.

for plotting vectors on RGB or cropping image with Matlab codes, the timelapse image should first be saved as individual slice of .tif
(use the save images from stack.ijm) 

for tfm_quantification_ht.m, the ROI zip file contains ROIs manually drawn in ImageJ.
The code supports multiple ROIs in one timepoint.
But WILL CALCULATES TRACTION AND AREA FROM ALL ROIS IN THAT TIMEPOINT.
(If you want to calculate traction for 2 different cells, then you need to separate them into 2 ROI zip) 
The naming of ROI should be in the following format: slice - ROI
eg. the first ROI in the first timepoint: 1-1
(p.s. if you don't have multiple selection, can just treat it as the first ROI)
